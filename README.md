# Committed Dev Log
I do read all feature requests! Not every feature on this list is guarenteed to be added, since Committed is a side project I work on in my spare time.

## Todos
- Add icon
- test if everything works locally + as an extension
- tutorial
- consistent naming: "textColor" -> "fontColor", "duedate" -> "dueDate"
- rewrite with react hooks (context -> useReducer & useEffect)

- Firefox support
- progress
- write tests
- todo cross out when done
- settings:
  - duedate format
  - delete / not delete completed todos at the end of the day

## Done
- settings:
  - input placeholder format (clock, date, custom quote, 12/24-hour clock)
  - hide / show completed todos
- subtodos (lists)
- styling to input placeholder
- style tooltip
- local & chrome storage
- update todos at the end of the day
- show all / show completed / due today / due this week (view saved)
- Todo updates

## In consideration
- general notes intead of a todo
- create your own list
- Google tasks integration
- Labeling tasks (ASAP, TBA, etc)
- Sort tasks (e.g. by due dates)
- Make sure the tasks that repeat disappear and appear again once its close to due.
- Allow the size of font and lines to be adjusted to individual preference.
- allow todo list to be printed / exported
