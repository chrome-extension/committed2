# Committed Dev Log

I do read all feature requests! Not every feature on this list is guarenteed to be added, since Committed is a side project I work on in my spare time.

## Todos
- tutorial
- show all / show completed / due today / due this week (view saved)
- settings:
  - input placeholder format (clock, date, custom quote)
  - duedate format
  - delete / not delete completed todos at the end of the day
  - hide / show completed todos
- subtodos
- local storage, chrome storage
- write tests

## In consideration
- create your own list
- Google tasks integration
- Labeling tasks
- Sort tasks (e.g. by due dates)
- Make sure the tasks that repeat disappear and appear again once its close to due.
- Allow the size of font and lines to be adjusted to individual preference.
