# Committed Dev Log
I do read all feature requests! Not every feature on this list is guarenteed to be added, since Committed is a side project I work on in my spare time.

## Requested features
- Google tasks integration
- Labeling tasks (ASAP, TBA, etc)
- Allow the size of font and lines to be adjusted to individual preference.
- Allow todo list to be printed / exported
- Firefox support
- Sort tasks (e.g. by due dates)

## Todos
- Tutorial
- Consistent naming: "textColor" -> "fontColor", "duedate" -> "dueDate"
- Rewrite Contexts with React Hooks (useReducer, useEffect)
- Write tests
- progress
- Settings:
  - Duedate display format (show "due in X days" instead of a date)
